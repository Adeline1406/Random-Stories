Upon winning the lottery, 
Longing for a simpler life, 
Suffering from amnesia, 
While dog-sitting, 
After graduating from charm school, 
Ignoring the advice of friends, 
Having poisoned the soup, 
While on a second honeymoon, 
Spoiled by a lifetime of luxury, 
After too many cups of coffee, 
Undercover for a top government agency, 
After winning a bet, 
Upon winning the Nobel Prize, 
On the run from federal agents, 
Vowing not to bathe for an entire year, 
After misreading an e-mail, 
After a case of mistaken identity, 
During a leap year, 
Gifted with paranormal abilities, 
Under a witch's spell,
